# ESP32 NTRIP Duo
This is modified version of ESP32 xbee.

Main difference is that this have two NTRIP servers that can be running at the same time to be able to feed Onocoy and RTK Direct!!!

ESP32 NTRIP Duo is made with [ESP-IDF](https://github.com/espressif/esp-idf). Its main function is to forward the UART of the ESP32 to a variety of protocols over WiFi.

In this version Installation is simplified, with just a single bin file. You can use ESPHome web flasher https://web.esphome.io/ just connect your ESP32 dev board to PC, select connect, cho0se correct COM port, connect and install. On popup choose bin file and click install.

This software can run on ESP32 WROOM type. Now added ESP32S3, ESP32C3, ESP32S2  Just choose correct bin file!
For ESP32S2 if ESPHome is not connecting (it didn't with S2mini) You can use https://tasmota.github.io/install/ to install with single bin file.
